# NLU_Assignment3

Since grammar file was too large, it was unable to upload on Github.
The a3_train.py file creates a pickle of the grammar model and a3_test.py loads that grammer model to generate the parsed tree output

In the server, the shell script will invoke Grammer file, which I have made during training of the Model and it will generate Parsed Output as shown in th figure below :

# Path to shell script on the server
# /home/e1-246-20/Final/run.sh
